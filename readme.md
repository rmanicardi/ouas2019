This is my first CBM Basic game I decided to create for the contest promoted by Once Upon a Sprite 2019 (https://m.facebook.com/groups/retroprogrammazione/permalink/715469292261877/).

The concept is *heavily* inspired by the old Gorilla.bas game shipped with MSDos and written in QBasic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)).

I've started with a port of that game to CBM Basic. My work environment was a patched version of TOK64 (as it didn't compile for MacOS Mojave) which you'll find in this repo too. I've also build my sprite editor in Excel (you can find under docs).

The Basic source code is gorilla-ouas.txt, compiled with TOK64 in the gorilla-ouas.prg

This was a chance for me to play with video RAM, sprites and SID.

I hope you'll enjoy it!
