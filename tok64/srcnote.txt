Well, after years of hanging onto it, here's the
source code for TOK64. You may use it in your own
coding efforts but you must give me credit. You may
not charge money for the code which I allow you to
use.

While packing up TOK64 source code for publishing
on my web page I noticed that the include file
directories may be different, so make adjustments
accordingly.

Happy coding!
